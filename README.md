# UNF-Degree-Planner
This repository features a redesigned class registration platform for the University of North Florida (UNF) that improves the outdated system by enhancing prerequisite visibility, course search functionality, error messaging, and reducing unnecessary manual data entry.

Our solution introduces an intuitive web-based interface that allows students to clearly see their required courses, understand prerequisites, and register only for classes they are eligible to take based on their academic data. The platform separates course search from registration to streamline the process and reduce confusion.

Additionally, the project incorporates gamification to enhance student engagement. Students can customize a digital version of UNF’s mascot, Ozzie, unlocking clothing and accessories as they complete degree requirements. This feature encourages academic progress while creating a more interactive and rewarding registration experience.

Overall, this repository presents a modern, student-centered approach to simplifying and enhancing the course planning and registration process at UNF.
